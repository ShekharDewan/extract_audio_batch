# Video to Audio Extractor (Original Quality)

This tool extracts the **original audio stream** from video files **without re-encoding**, preserving full audio quality. It uses `ffmpeg` to copy the audio stream directly and supports all major video formats. The tool automatically detects the correct audio format and saves the output to a separate folder.
